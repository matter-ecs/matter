## Installation

Matter can be installed with [Wally] by including it as a dependency in your
`wally.toml` file.

```toml
Matter = "matter-ecs/matter@0.7.0"
```

## Building

Before building, you'll need to install all dependencies using [Wally].

You can then sync or build the project with [Rojo]. Matter contains several
project files with different builds of the project. The `default.project.json`
is the package build. The `example.project.json` is the example game build.
