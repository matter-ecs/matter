**Matter** is a modern ECS library for _[Roblox]_.

[roblox]: https://www.roblox.com/

## Installation

Matter can be installed with [Wally] by including it as a dependency in your
`wally.toml` file.

```toml
Matter = "matter-ecs/matter@0.7.1"
```

## Migration

If you're currently using the scope `evaera/matter`, prior versions are the same
package. You can migrate by changing your `wally.toml` file to use the scope
`matter-ecs/matter`.

## Building

Before building, you'll need to install all dependencies using [Wally].

You can then sync or build the project with [Rojo]. Matter contains several
project files with different builds of the project. The `default.project.json`
is the package build. The `example.project.json` is the example game build.
